## What is TTE or ETA?
- The popularity of location technology has produced massive trajectory data of moving vehicles, such as the driving trajectories of taxis, buses, private cars, and other automobiles.
- ***Travel time estimation (TTE)***, also known as the ***Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)***, predicts the actual travel duration time of the driving route and assists the driver in planning the route and avoiding congested road segments.
- It is significant in traffic management, carpooling, vehicle dispatching, and other location-based service (LBS) applications.

</p>

## Relationship Between TTE and Other SpatioTemporal Tasks
- **(1) Traffic Imputation**: Ensures the completeness of traffic data and enhances the predictive performance of traffic forecasting models.  
- **(2) Road Network Representation Learning**: Captures the spatial and topological relationships between road segments, improving the accuracy of traffic prediction.  
- **(3) Traffic Prediction**: Provides dynamic and real-time traffic conditions for travel time estimation.  
- **(4) Travel Time Estimation**: Infers the estimated time of arrival and plans routes while avoiding congestion for given origin-destination pairs. It is widely applied in navigation systems, route planning, ride-hailing services, and more.

- Overall, these tasks collectively form the critical components of **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)**. They are interdependent and complementary, working together to enhance urban transportation networks' overall efficiency.

## Proposed TTE Models by DiDi and Baidu
- DiDi and Baidu, two leading corporations, have each developed models for Travel Time Estimation (TTE) with the goal of improving the efficiency of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), navigation, route planning, and ride-hailing services.

</p>
<p align = "center">
<b>Figure 3. The Technological Development Trends of Two Well-known Companies in the TTE Field. </b> 
</p>

- DiDi's representative approach was the **Wide-Deep-Recurrent (WDR)** model in 2018. This model combines a wide linear model, deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks to capture both the global statistical information and the local detailed information of a route. Later, by integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and attention mechanisms, **DiDi proposed the HetETA (2020) and HierETA (2022)**.
- Baidu's representative method was the proposal of the **ConSTGAT model** in 2020, an end-to-end neural framework that integrates traffic prediction and contextual information of a route. This model employs a novel graph attention mechanism to fully leverage the joint relationships of spatial and temporal information. Subsequently, building upon ConSTGAT, **Baidu introduced the DuETA (2022) and GBTTE (2023)**, both of which have been deployed on Baidu Maps, handling billions of requests daily.
- **In summary**, DiDi focuses on utilizing a diverse array of features, including route information, traffic conditions, and personalized information. Baidu, in addition to utilizing these features, also places special emphasis on the contextual information of routes, such as the connectivity between adjacent road segments.

## Open Source Traffic and Trajectory Datasets
- Here, we have collected and organized #20 **Trajectory-based datasets** that can be used for **Traffic Prediction (flow, speed, etc.) and Travel Time Estimation (TTE/ETA)** tasks!
